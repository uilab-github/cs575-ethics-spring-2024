### Lecture
Lecturer or student groups will give lecture of each topic by each day.

### Reading Reflections
Students will read, present, and think about latest research from the reading list which is published in AI and ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICLR, ACL, CVPR, FAccT) related to ethical considerations.
Readings may also include blog posts, articles in the media, online forum discussions, and publications from global governing bodies.
* Choose a paper related to the topic of the lecture from the [reading list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MG2dAGy_JhvHdrXhp6LNvicH7Yw13Hfxcth8PLqZdYc/edit?usp=sharing).
* Read the paper before the discussion and write a 1-page reflections of the paper including summary, strengths, limitations, and suggestions.

### Discussion
Students will lead peers to discuss the readings with thought-provoking questions.
You will challenge the findings in the articles as to their accurate reporting and interpretation; you will discuss relevance to the current time and various locales with different cultural backgrounds.
You will present and discuss ideas for future research directions in AI and ethics.
* 20 in-class discussion (see schedule).
* Organize a group of 3 people, and have time to present what you read and discuss
* All groups should submit their result at the end of class.
* See the details on this [page](https://uilab-kaist.github.io/cs575-ethics-spring-2023/discussion).

### Team Project
Team project will be a major part of the class, especially during the second half.
Projects will be basically replications or modifications of recent research in AI Ethics.
See the details on this [page](https://uilab-kaist.github.io/cs575-ethics-spring-2023/project).

### Policy on Large Language Models
Recent progress in large-scale language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT, motivate explicit policies.
* The entire course policy is **LLM-agnostic**: no grader will ever evaluate your submission differently because they suspect it was genereted by an LLM.
* You are free to use an LLM as long as you **acknowledge** it.
* You are ultimately responsible for whatever you submit like with any other online tool.
* You will be asked to state how you are assisted by LLM in the end of the semester to evolve in future courses.

## Evaluation (Subject to Change)

* In-class Discussion / Reading Reflections: 30%
