### Lecture
Lecturer or student groups will give a lecture on each topic by each day.

### Reading Reflections
Students will read, present, and think about the latest research from the reading list published in AI and ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICLR, ACL, CVPR, FAccT) related to ethical considerations.
Readings may also include blog posts, articles in the media, online forum discussions, and publications from global governing bodies.
* Choose a paper related to the lecture topic from the [reading list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xi2Z7hNtFZtil06slEcVAPT-QZEp4g-s/edit#gid=1112436071).
* Read the paper before the discussion and write a 1-page reflection on the paper, including a summary, strengths, limitations, and suggestions.

### Discussion
Students will lead peers to discuss the readings with thought-provoking questions.
You will challenge the findings in the articles as to their accurate reporting and interpretation; you will discuss relevance to the current time and various locales with different cultural backgrounds.
You will present and discuss ideas for future research directions in AI and ethics.
* 20 in-class discussions (see schedule).
* Organize a group of 3-4 people, and have time to present what you read and discuss
* All groups should submit their result at the end of class.
* See the details on this [page](https://uilab-kaist.github.io/cs575-ethics-spring-2024/discussion).

### Team Project
Team project will be a major part of the class, especially during the second half.
Projects will be basically replications or modifications of recent research in AI Ethics.
See the details on this [page](https://uilab-kaist.github.io/cs575-ethics-spring-2024/project).

### Policy on Large Language Models
Recent progress in large-scale language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT, motivates explicit policies.
* The entire course policy is **LLM-agnostic**: no grader will ever evaluate your submission differently because they suspect it was generated by an LLM.
* You are free to use an LLM as long as you **acknowledge** it.
* Like any other online tool, you are ultimately responsible for whatever you submit.
* You will be asked to state how you are assisted by LLM at the end of the semester to evolve in future courses.

## Evaluation (Subject to Change)
* Participation and Attendance: 20%
* In-class Discussion / Reading Reflections: 30%
* Project: 50%
